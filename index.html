During the morning, students rotated through a series of stations designed to challenge their running, jumping and throwing skills. Among the stations were a 50-yard dash, a flying disc toss, jump rope, a standing long jump, a bean bag toss and a glow stick bottle toss. There was also a station where students were asked to kick a soccer ball for distance.</p>
